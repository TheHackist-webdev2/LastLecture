                <h1>Day of Love - Myrna Velasco</h1>
                <p>One of the most fascinating concepts of human behavior to me is the fact that we don’t do things other species do to just stay alive, but to feel like we are actually living. The prime example of this is love. The laws of survival tell us we should eat, sleep, keep our species going, and do whatever it takes to not die. If you think about it, love makes us do some things that are out of accordance with these laws. We give up sleep to be on a phone call  with our significant other that has been going for two hours already. We share food with friends even though we were saving that for later. We risk injuries and failure for sports, dance, and art, but we do these things anyway. Love is sacrifice. Love is giving a portion of your life to someone or something willingly.  Love is letting something/someone know you and change you. Love is about caring for something or someone before thinking about yourself. I love the word “falling” in the phrase “falling in love” because it embodies the feeling perfectly. Once you start, it’s really hard to catch yourself or stop; you are subject to obey a force that is out of your control. You can either resist and brace yourself for impact, or you can spread your arms and dive in head first. It also implies that the outcome in unknown; you could be falling on gravel, or you could be falling into a memory foam mush pit of joy. I don’t know about you, but I’m terrified of heights. Falling can be scary, especially when you don’t know how hard you are going to fall or what you are going to land on. But as far away as we try to get from the ledge, our instinct to love brings us back every time. Nature tells us to protect ourselves;, but our humanity tells us to love. It always comes back to it. Our society cannot run without love. Why else would parents work several jobs to provide for their children? Why would children assign themselves responsibilities to care for a creature of a completely different species then cry when it dies or gets lost? Why else would teachers stay long hours, talk through our problems, give us an education, all with relatively small income for hundreds of students who do not belong to them? Why would mothers willingly feel miserable for nine months then risk their lives to bring you here if they did not love you? Whether it is for a person, a sport, a pet, an idea, a hobby, or a profession, everything revolves around love. It is the greatest motivation. I believe iit is the best thing we do.</p>

                <h1>Done Goof-Patrick Madden</h1>
                <p>Before I begin I would just like to say thank you to all of the incredible teachers and other staff here at Maeser. You have all been so wonderful to me. Even those that I’ve never had. I found that the easiest way to describe how I feel was said by Glen Phillips, “I often feel like the prodigal son, take all I need, giving back none.” There are too many times for me to count when I have been shown great kindness and love from the people of this school. So once again, thanks to everyone in the school, students and faculty alike. Now to my advice.</p>

                <h1>High School Eugoogly-Camila Ortega</h1>
                <p>In a few days I’m walking down the aisle. I’m not getting married, but something close to it, I’m marrying adulthood. I’ll leave childhood being completely honest. High school is nothing like High School Musical. Your sibling won’t ever agree to be your singing sidekick, people you love will hurt you and won’t sing you an apology, and people never fall in love over karaoke. But high school has taught me many valuable life lessons; like embracing who and what you love defines you, being happy is always an option, and dropping it too low to apple-bottom jeans when you’re wearing hair extensions is a guaranteed disaster. </p>

                <h1>Less Common Advice- Camden Walton</h1>
                <p>Every last lecture, no matter how unique, always has a few of the same themes. love your time in high school, make friends, be yourself, don’t procrastinate. Don’t get me wrong, those are all important, but I’m not just standing in front of you to parrot the banal platitudes you hear every year in a new way. I’m going to give you advice that I feel is less commonly shared<br>
                    It’s okay to be sad, sometimes that just happens. Anxiety, depression, stress, fear, they’re all a part of your life, don’t pretend they’re not, that’s unhealthy. Don’t wallow in them either though. Take them when they come, but you shouldn’t be seeking any of them out. It’ll pass.</p>

                <h1>Love Oozers - Lela Wooley</h1>
                <p>Everyone wants to see you succeed, just so long as you stay beneath them.<br>
                    HA! That’s bull. Why can’t we all be like Framptinez? Or like Rachel Linford? Riley Corrigan? Ashlyn Coyle? All of those people have something in common. They’re all Love Oozers. And what’s a Love Oozer?<br>
                    Well. Someone who oozes love is simply… pure and caring. Non-judgemental. They see the best of what’s in you, and they see your potential, and strive to coax it out. Those people wish to see others succeed in doing what they love.</p>

                <p>The world outside suddenly silenced. Salty beads of sweat zigged and zagged past my nose and toward the ground as I gasped for air, head in between my knees. This was it, the fourth quarter, trailing by two. Derek Smith approached the line the line to attempt his second free throw. 8.5 on the clock. It was time for the Tade show.</p>

                <h1>The Hands That Saved Me - Jocelyn Garcia</h1>
                <p>A few unexpected things happened in the past four years here at Maeser.<br>
                    I passed AP stats.<br>
                    I met my soul sister at locker 364.<br>
                    I somehow stayed quiet in class for one day. Just one.<br>
                    I somehow got someone to stop hating me and now he’s my best friend.<br>
                    But the one I never imagined was that it would be characters in books who would  help me through life’s everyday moments. Every book I read within these walls has been a hand reaching down to save me from an abyss.</p>

                <h1>What Is A Legacy? - Brittany Overson</h1>
                <p>For the last six years, I have been a student at Maeser and let me just say this: I regret not thinking about my own legacy until senior year. I want to leave behind something that will hopefully help underclassmen in the future. Questions I asked myself this year and that I hope you will ask yourself are: What do I want to leave behind?How do you want the students in this school to remember you? What does your legacy mean to you?</p>

                <h1>Work, Time and Laughter - Kendall Bailey</h1>
                <p>It’s not possible to sum up six years of lessons and experience in only seven hundred and fifty words. Trust me, I’ve tried. But I can share a few things I have learned.<br>
                    Being on the cross country team my junior and senior year was definitely a way I learned and grew. It felt like I was a part of a family. That’s what happens when you spend hours at practice and meets together, when the jokes flow freely, when you run, sweat, breathe, and collapse together. We crunched. We sprinted. We did hills. We cheered each other to the finish line. We waited to use the one seater in a tiny grocery store called Workman’s Market in Helper, Utah. We chanted “Run with purpose. Run with pride. Rise up it’s Lion’s time. RAWR!” for the first few hundred yards of a race we were late to. I don’t remember any of my times from any of my races. The pain I felt while running has blurred into a hazy memory. But I do remember my teammates. The cross country team taught me to laugh no matter what. Even when the bus is on one side of the mountain and the meet you are supposed to be running in is on the other.</p>
