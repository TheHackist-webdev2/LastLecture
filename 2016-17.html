                <h1>ABC Is Not As Easy As 1, 2, 3 - Lia Joo</h1>
                <p>I had spent the whole year interpreting the charade of a language called English. From the first week of school to the last, the amount of time I spent sitting on a cold chair mimicking the foreign sounds my teacher let out of her mouth shortened little by little. By the end of the school year, I saw her back turning away from me more than I saw her face. My teacher had given up on teaching me. So naturally, as a 5 year old, making it to first grade seemed impossible. But my mom told me to be patient and to never quit. Now, it was the last day of kindergarten and the teacher assigned one last assignment. The prompt was to write about anything you felt or learned in the school year so I stuck to the basics: the ABC’s. And no Michael Jackson, they were not as easy as 1,2,3.</p>

                <h1>Accepting the Label - Felix Resendiz Jr.</h1>
                <p>Who are you? It’s the question I ask myself as I stare into my soap stained mirror each morning as I’m brushing my teeth. This is how I start my day. It hasn’t always been my routine. When I was in grade school I was a fat kid. I was known as a Macho man not for my strength but for my size. Everyone assumed that I was full Mexican but little did they know I’m more Chilean than Mexican... Being fat and Chilean made it hard to accept who I am. I didn’t realized that I was just going through a physical phase. I was stereotyped as a mexican and no one cared to ask about my background   That impacted my life because I didn’t have the same respect like the other more “privileged” kid in this “white society and country”. Being how little I was I did not know that I could change, I didn’t like it.But as I got older I realized that I can change. I realized that I wasn’t apart of the stereotype, I spoke up more, I ran a little more, I became my own person.  I know that I am not the only one that has gone through this, everyone has or will go through this, solely for the fact they are different from one another.</p>

                <h1>Convinced - Emma Cole</h1>
                <p>I was convinced I was going to die for the majority of my Freshman year. Tense shoulders, headaches, panic Attacks, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder ruled my life. Few things helped. Talking to Maren was one.<br>
                    Because she’d been through more in her 17 years than most people go through in a lifetime, she understood me unlike anybody else I knew.<br>
                    One day I came home from school feeling worse than usual. I tried to start on homework, but broke down, familiar terror filling my body. I shook. I hyperventilated. I couldn’t breathe. My teeth buzzed. Thoughts raced through my brain, and though I knew logically that it wasn’t true, I thought I was going to fail in school and life. As I laid tearstained, drained, and broken in the aftermath, I texted Maren. She left the library to FaceTime me. I laid there and told her about my day. At this lowest moment, even she didn’t know how to make me feel better. In futility, she grabbed a stick from the ground and held it up for me to see. She said she didn’t have anything to give me, being a poor college student. But she offered the stick if it would help. I smiled, probably for the first time that day, or even that week. I held up a hair elastic and said I didn’t have anything to give back to her, being a 14 year old girl, but I had that hair band.<br>
                    All we had to give was a stick and a hair elastic, but it was enough.</p>

                <h1>High School is a Womb - Max Bradshaw</h1>
                <p>Babies scare me. An odd statement, I'm aware. I am also aware that they are completely harmless, but so is Coach Watabe and yet a lot of people seem to be scared of him. Despite all the cute cuddliness that a baby inherently possesses, there is something about them that freaks me out. Maybe I've simply watched too many horror movies with a devil baby in them. But it’s probably the fact that I too, used to be in that helpless and dependent state. And 17 years later, while I may be just as helpless and dependent, now I’m supposed to be graduating and doing stuff on my own.<br>
                    High school is exactly like being in a womb. Okay… well maybe not exactly but you get the idea. It is where we, as fetuses, are nurtured in the claustrophobic space that is the middle school hallway. We slowly grow and our organs develop. (But that actually happens in the classrooms, so maybe the middle school hallway is the placenta? I'm pretty sure this is getting too weird… it is, isn't it?). We learn what we are and aren't good at. What we aspire to be, and what we don't want to be. In short, we learn and develop who we are. We also learn more about the world around us through all of the classes that we take. Not only do we learn how to find the rate at which a potato cools using some major math skills (or a lack thereof in my case), but we also learn about people. Who we like, who we want to be around, who inspires us to become a better person and the opposite of those as well. We learn how to deal with all of these. And just when we think we are actually starting to figure this whole thing out and getting comfortable; we are thrust out unceremoniously (since the actual graduation ceremony is basically a delivery room with a little more fanfare, and a lot more spectators) and are now expected to use all of these skills​ we have just developed. And if we can't survive with the amount of development we have, we die, or at least require some major medical attention.</p>

                <h1>Just A Ghost - Maia Bjarnson</h1>
                <p>I am a ghost. Well, a living ghost. A warm body that walks the school hallways. “Is that Mia? Maia? Bjarnson? Bejarnson? Wait, are you new here?” I have been going here since seventh grade. It is so hard to love yourself when you feel like nobody. It is hard to love yourself when you don’t feel special. “You need to love yourself.” My life has been a series of that phrase. I lay in my bed, my room so messy you can barely see the floor. “Girl, you need to love yourself.” A 4.0 last term, a 3.0 this term, and tears dancing down my cheeks. “It’s okay, you just need to love yourself.” An angry whack of my tennis racket after missing each shot. “Love yourself. Have confidence!” Well, If you were to rip me open you would find a broken heart and dust that lines the walls where my self-love should be.</p>
