                <h1>ABC Is Not As Easy As 1, 2, 3 - Lia Joo</h1>
                <p>I had spent the whole year interpreting the charade of a language called English. From the first week of school to the last, the amount of time I spent sitting on a cold chair mimicking the foreign sounds my teacher let out of her mouth shortened little by little. By the end of the school year, I saw her back turning away from me more than I saw her face. My teacher had given up on teaching me. So naturally, as a 5 year old, making it to first grade seemed impossible. But my mom told me to be patient and to never quit. Now, it was the last day of kindergarten and the teacher assigned one last assignment. The prompt was to write about anything you felt or learned in the school year so I stuck to the basics: the ABC’s. And no Michael Jackson, they were not as easy as 1,2,3.</p>

                <h1>Accepting the Label - Felix Resendiz Jr.</h1>
                <p>Who are you? It’s the question I ask myself as I stare into my soap stained mirror each morning as I’m brushing my teeth. This is how I start my day. It hasn’t always been my routine. When I was in grade school I was a fat kid. I was known as a Macho man not for my strength but for my size. Everyone assumed that I was full Mexican but little did they know I’m more Chilean than Mexican... Being fat and Chilean made it hard to accept who I am. I didn’t realized that I was just going through a physical phase. I was stereotyped as a mexican and no one cared to ask about my background   That impacted my life because I didn’t have the same respect like the other more “privileged” kid in this “white society and country”. Being how little I was I did not know that I could change, I didn’t like it.But as I got older I realized that I can change. I realized that I wasn’t apart of the stereotype, I spoke up more, I ran a little more, I became my own person.  I know that I am not the only one that has gone through this, everyone has or will go through this, solely for the fact they are different from one another.</p>

                <h1>Convinced - Emma Cole</h1>
                <p>I was convinced I was going to die for the majority of my Freshman year. Tense shoulders, headaches, panic Attacks, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder ruled my life. Few things helped. Talking to Maren was one.<br>
                    Because she’d been through more in her 17 years than most people go through in a lifetime, she understood me unlike anybody else I knew.<br>
                    One day I came home from school feeling worse than usual. I tried to start on homework, but broke down, familiar terror filling my body. I shook. I hyperventilated. I couldn’t breathe. My teeth buzzed. Thoughts raced through my brain, and though I knew logically that it wasn’t true, I thought I was going to fail in school and life. As I laid tearstained, drained, and broken in the aftermath, I texted Maren. She left the library to FaceTime me. I laid there and told her about my day. At this lowest moment, even she didn’t know how to make me feel better. In futility, she grabbed a stick from the ground and held it up for me to see. She said she didn’t have anything to give me, being a poor college student. But she offered the stick if it would help. I smiled, probably for the first time that day, or even that week. I held up a hair elastic and said I didn’t have anything to give back to her, being a 14 year old girl, but I had that hair band.<br>
                    All we had to give was a stick and a hair elastic, but it was enough.</p>

                <h1>High School is a Womb - Max Bradshaw</h1>
                <p>Babies scare me. An odd statement, I'm aware. I am also aware that they are completely harmless, but so is Coach Watabe and yet a lot of people seem to be scared of him. Despite all the cute cuddliness that a baby inherently possesses, there is something about them that freaks me out. Maybe I've simply watched too many horror movies with a devil baby in them. But it’s probably the fact that I too, used to be in that helpless and dependent state. And 17 years later, while I may be just as helpless and dependent, now I’m supposed to be graduating and doing stuff on my own.<br>
                    High school is exactly like being in a womb. Okay… well maybe not exactly but you get the idea. It is where we, as fetuses, are nurtured in the claustrophobic space that is the middle school hallway. We slowly grow and our organs develop. (But that actually happens in the classrooms, so maybe the middle school hallway is the placenta? I'm pretty sure this is getting too weird… it is, isn't it?). We learn what we are and aren't good at. What we aspire to be, and what we don't want to be. In short, we learn and develop who we are. We also learn more about the world around us through all of the classes that we take. Not only do we learn how to find the rate at which a potato cools using some major math skills (or a lack thereof in my case), but we also learn about people. Who we like, who we want to be around, who inspires us to become a better person and the opposite of those as well. We learn how to deal with all of these. And just when we think we are actually starting to figure this whole thing out and getting comfortable; we are thrust out unceremoniously (since the actual graduation ceremony is basically a delivery room with a little more fanfare, and a lot more spectators) and are now expected to use all of these skills​ we have just developed. And if we can't survive with the amount of development we have, we die, or at least require some major medical attention.</p>

                <h1>Just A Ghost - Maia Bjarnson</h1>
                <p>I am a ghost. Well, a living ghost. A warm body that walks the school hallways. “Is that Mia? Maia? Bjarnson? Bejarnson? Wait, are you new here?” I have been going here since seventh grade. It is so hard to love yourself when you feel like nobody. It is hard to love yourself when you don’t feel special. “You need to love yourself.” My life has been a series of that phrase. I lay in my bed, my room so messy you can barely see the floor. “Girl, you need to love yourself.” A 4.0 last term, a 3.0 this term, and tears dancing down my cheeks. “It’s okay, you just need to love yourself.” An angry whack of my tennis racket after missing each shot. “Love yourself. Have confidence!” Well, If you were to rip me open you would find a broken heart and dust that lines the walls where my self-love should be.</p>

                <h1>Less Common Advice- Camden Walton</h1>
                <p>Every last lecture, no matter how unique, always has a few of the same themes. love your time in high school, make friends, be yourself, don’t procrastinate. Don’t get me wrong, those are all important, but I’m not just standing in front of you to parrot the banal platitudes you hear every year in a new way. I’m going to give you advice that I feel is less commonly shared<br>
                    It’s okay to be sad, sometimes that just happens. Anxiety, depression, stress, fear, they’re all a part of your life, don’t pretend they’re not, that’s unhealthy. Don’t wallow in them either though. Take them when they come, but you shouldn’t be seeking any of them out. It’ll pass.</p>

                <h1>The Fantastic Voyage - Braden Christiansen</h1>
                <p>You would think after four years of Highschool that I would be great at staying up late to write Last Lectures and finish Calculus integrals but I'm not. You would have to be really good at math in order to count the times I have heard a teacher say you just need to work hard.<br>
                    People always say hard work is the way to succeed at anything. Do you want to write a great paper? Work hard, ask people for their opinions but you need to make an effort. What never gets recognised however is that there are times that trying your best and working hard doesn’t pay off and it's really hard to hear somebody say you could have done better when you tried as hard as you could. How most people manage that is by becoming objective hard workers. Picking aspects of their life that they will work hard at. One of those aspects for me is playing soccer. I've played for almost all of my life but I only realised that I wanted to be good at it my Freshmen year. So naturally by senior year you would think that I was at least decent at the game to the point where I could start varsity, the end goal for any soccer player, but if you're thinking that then you obviously don’t know me very well because I have the coordination of a blind astronaut.</p>

                <h1>Breaking Up - Dylan Armstrong</h1>
                <p>So you may have heard, I’m graduating next week. I know it’s crazy right. Me of all people. One day and then it’s all over, I never see any of you again. (Well unless you are James Johnson, then you’ve been stuck with me since 2nd grade and I’m living across the street from you at college, so you're never getting rid of me.) What I mean to say is this isn’t working, and no it’s not me, it’s mostly you. It is over. I’m breaking up with you. All of you. (Even you Allyson.) We are never ever getting back together, like ever. I mean we’ve been together for six years… but it’s time to move on. I mean I’m going to college next year, and I don’t want a long distance relationship, it’s time to say goodbye. It’s over, but that doesn’t mean none of it mattered. I’ve learned so much from you, Maeser has taught me how to be me. It’s the end, but the end is just the begining of another journey. I’m sure you’ll find someone else. So since this is goodbye, I wanted to tell you I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all my bad jokes, late assignments, and mistakes that I’ve made. I’ll miss you. I’ll miss the environment a small of high school, the teachers actually knowing my name, and all the friends I made along the way. I forgive you. I forgive you for all the late night assignments, for full dress Monday’s, and for the most stressful years of my life. Finally, I love you. I love you for showing me who I should aim to be, for all the fun I had along the way, and for the best years of my life. Goodbye Maeser, I hope we can still be friends.</p>

                <h1>Doing Things - Bennett Felstead</h1>
                <p>Charles Darwin once said “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change”. Now, while Charlie Darwin never actually said that, I still think it’s a good point. The most important thing that I learned from going to high school, was how to accustom myself to different situations, or as a normal person would say, how to adapt. One of the major things that I had to adapt to was to, as I eloquently put it, do things. Let me explain. I don’t mean the typical ‘go to every single thing ever and do all that you can always at the school’. I mean that I needed to start breaking the habit of not doing what I was supposed to do. I feel like we have all been in that situation, when you need to do some big project and instead of doing it early, you wait until that last second just to, you know, make your brain have a panic attack. I remember I had a physics project where we had to build a mousetrap car. It was due on thursday, so naturally I was going to wait until wednesday night to start it. But, this is when I realized that procrastination is an evil thing. I woke up monday, went to school, only to realize that the car was due that day… I failed that class. Now, realizing that procrastination is a bad thing is very different from actually doing something about your procrastination. It’s very hard to switch from something you’ve been doing for so long. But trust me, it’s worth the effort.</p>

                <h1>Life Before Death, Strength Before Weakness, Journey Before Destination - Taylor LaFranca</h1>
                <p>Life before death, fairly obvious right? I mean, we are living before we’re dead, so why is it important to say? Before I came to Maeser I had a life, but I wasn’t living it. Back in my old school, I was bullied and pushed around because I didn’t fit in. I was treated differently because I wasn’t who they wanted me to be. The phrase life before death means that we need to look at our lives, evaluate ourselves, and decide. “Am I really living my life?” I’ve been there, I know what it’s like to be alive, but not really living and I’m here to tell you, live your life, do what you want to do, not just what others expect you to do.</p>

                    Well. Someone who oozes love is simply… pure and caring. Non-judgemental. They see the best of what’s in you, and they see your potential, and strive to coax it out. Those people wish to see others succeed in doing what they love.</p>

At age 5, I believed making my own pot of macaroni was the final frontier.

                <p>Everyday I am bombarded with choices. In the morning I get to choose if I want to eat frosted flakes or fruity pebbles. In the winter I get to choose to freeze to death or wear a winter jacket and get yelled at by Mr Dowdle. At the end of the term I get to choose if I want to do the huge project due the next day that's worth half of my grade or cry myself to sleep.<br>
                    But I had one choice five years ago that would change my life drastically.  It was the choice of not moving to Hong Kong with my family. You guys might think not living with your parents is the best thing ever… and it is the best thing ever… but only for the first few months. The first few months is total freedom! No one is around to bug you about anything. Everything is going perfect. Then it hits you’re failing half of your classes, you can’t see the ground in your room, and no one is there to tuck you into bed at night. At that moment, you realize you miss your family.</p>

                <h1>Fail Fail Fail - James Johnson</h1>
                <p>Hi guys. Last year, there was a super cool lecture held at UVU. An actor from a popular television show (which I will keep nameless) had flown in to speak to their drama department. My awesome older sister checked me out of school to take me to see it. He talked about his show and working in the acting business. At the end he opened it up for questions, and out of the gigantic crowd, he called on me. I asked if he had any good advice for actors, and he gave me the greatest piece of knowledge that I’ve ever received. He said only three words, “Fail, fail, fail.” At first I was confused, and I thought to myself, “Wait, don’t we want to avoid failure? Aren’t we supposed to succeed in life?” He went on to explain that the only way that we can improve is by failing, and learning from those experiences. He said that he went to dozens of auditions, and instead of quitting, he chose to learn something new with each failure.  Eventually, after working very hard to utilize all that he learned, he was able to get the leading role in which he currently resides. So, in order to succeed, we must learn from our failures and put in the necessary work to be better.</p>

                <h1>What Do You Choose? - Shaun Cluff</h1>
                <p>I want to talk to you about choices. Let me tell you, you’re going to make a lot of them. Lucky for you though, I am the perfect person to give advice about this, because I am an Expert at making bad choices. At this point, you really start to think about all of the decisions you have made that have culminated to this moment. I remember as a sophomore I CHOSE to stay up till 2 am memorizing a monologue that I had procrastinated for a long time. In 9th grade I CHOSE to throw a pencil in 7th period biology that somehow ended up hitting Mr. Kreitzer in the forehead, earning me a trip to Mrs. Ellis’s office. Even this year I CHOSE to give Mrs. Macduff a heart attack when I almost got ran over in London. You see, these choices are  probably not the best, but there are some decisions I made with my education here at Maeser that I actually deeply regret. Choices that held me back from my potential. But Regret is not what got me here today. What I have learned at Maeser is how to make the right choices (most of the time, i’m still learning), and I hope that you can come to that same realization faster than I did.</p>

                <h1>What Is A Legacy? - Brittany Overson</h1>
                <p>For the last six years, I have been a student at Maeser and let me just say this: I regret not thinking about my own legacy until senior year. I want to leave behind something that will hopefully help underclassmen in the future. Questions I asked myself this year and that I hope you will ask yourself are: What do I want to leave behind?How do you want the students in this school to remember you? What does your legacy mean to you?</p>

                <h1>Work, Time and Laughter - Kendall Bailey</h1>
                <p>It’s not possible to sum up six years of lessons and experience in only seven hundred and fifty words. Trust me, I’ve tried. But I can share a few things I have learned.<br>
                    Being on the cross country team my junior and senior year was definitely a way I learned and grew. It felt like I was a part of a family. That’s what happens when you spend hours at practice and meets together, when the jokes flow freely, when you run, sweat, breathe, and collapse together. We crunched. We sprinted. We did hills. We cheered each other to the finish line. We waited to use the one seater in a tiny grocery store called Workman’s Market in Helper, Utah. We chanted “Run with purpose. Run with pride. Rise up it’s Lion’s time. RAWR!” for the first few hundred yards of a race we were late to. I don’t remember any of my times from any of my races. The pain I felt while running has blurred into a hazy memory. But I do remember my teammates. The cross country team taught me to laugh no matter what. Even when the bus is on one side of the mountain and the meet you are supposed to be running in is on the other.</p>

                <h1>My Crowning Glory - Steven Lawrence</h1>
                <p>For the first half of high school I was a straight A, shyer than shy, kid. I spent most of my time playing video games and doing what it took to get straight A’s in school. Each morning after eating breakfast I would lay in bed wondering why I should get in the shower to go to school. This would happen until I became so stressed about what might happen if I were to miss a day of school that I would end up getting in the shower and going to school. I was miserable. But this misery motivated me to change. I decided to start getting involved in extracurricular activities. I joined science olympiad, math team, and tennis, even though I was the worst player on the team; I lost every match. I worried less about school and focused more on my happiness by spending more time with family and friends and seizing opportunities to serve. Once I went to a college party with a friend who attended BYU because it was her birthday. The next day I had a project due for physics and I did terrible on it. As a general rule, you should try to get your homework done before you party but don’t let it get in the way of family, friends, and serving those who need help. Education is important but your happiness is the reason for your existence.</p>
