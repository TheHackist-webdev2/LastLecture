                <h1>Convinced - Emma Cole</h1>
                <p>I was convinced I was going to die for the majority of my Freshman year. Tense shoulders, headaches, panic Attacks, and Generalized Anxiety Disorder ruled my life. Few things helped. Talking to Maren was one.<br>
                    Because she’d been through more in her 17 years than most people go through in a lifetime, she understood me unlike anybody else I knew.<br>
                    One day I came home from school feeling worse than usual. I tried to start on homework, but broke down, familiar terror filling my body. I shook. I hyperventilated. I couldn’t breathe. My teeth buzzed. Thoughts raced through my brain, and though I knew logically that it wasn’t true, I thought I was going to fail in school and life. As I laid tearstained, drained, and broken in the aftermath, I texted Maren. She left the library to FaceTime me. I laid there and told her about my day. At this lowest moment, even she didn’t know how to make me feel better. In futility, she grabbed a stick from the ground and held it up for me to see. She said she didn’t have anything to give me, being a poor college student. But she offered the stick if it would help. I smiled, probably for the first time that day, or even that week. I held up a hair elastic and said I didn’t have anything to give back to her, being a 14 year old girl, but I had that hair band.<br>
                    All we had to give was a stick and a hair elastic, but it was enough.</p>

                <h1>Fear - Sarah Sorenson</h1>
                <p>Your heart beats faster than a galloping horse’s hooves, a rhythm so intense you can feel it pulsing from within your skull. Fictional characters always seem to worry about whoever is pursuing them being able to hear the frantic thumps, but no author can capture the sheer strength and volume of a heart that fears it may soon stop pumping. The rest of your body seems to get the message quite quickly and a shiver makes its way down your spine; eyes widen and hands begin to tremble as you realize what exactly has caused this involuntary response. You try to turn and run, but you soon understand what it means to be paralyzed by fear. You’ve become helpless in the face of this monstrosity, and your frozen body has left you completely at its mercy. Time seems to go faster and slower simultaneously, and it feels like you’re just there to watch. It doesn’t really matter what you insert into this, whether it be spiders, mind numbingly high drops, or clowns. Fear is fear, and it is an immensely powerful emotion. In Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, it is accurately described less as an irrational feeling and more as the rival of life. Fear is life’s true opponent because it begins in the mind, it can take control of people’s lives, and it is more powerful than death.

                <h1>Just A Ghost - Maia Bjarnson</h1>
                <p>I am a ghost. Well, a living ghost. A warm body that walks the school hallways. “Is that Mia? Maia? Bjarnson? Bejarnson? Wait, are you new here?” I have been going here since seventh grade. It is so hard to love yourself when you feel like nobody. It is hard to love yourself when you don’t feel special. “You need to love yourself.” My life has been a series of that phrase. I lay in my bed, my room so messy you can barely see the floor. “Girl, you need to love yourself.” A 4.0 last term, a 3.0 this term, and tears dancing down my cheeks. “It’s okay, you just need to love yourself.” An angry whack of my tennis racket after missing each shot. “Love yourself. Have confidence!” Well, If you were to rip me open you would find a broken heart and dust that lines the walls where my self-love should be.</p>
