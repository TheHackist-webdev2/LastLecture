                <h1>ABC Is Not As Easy As 1, 2, 3 - Lia Joo</h1>
                <p>I had spent the whole year interpreting the charade of a language called English. From the first week of school to the last, the amount of time I spent sitting on a cold chair mimicking the foreign sounds my teacher let out of her mouth shortened little by little. By the end of the school year, I saw her back turning away from me more than I saw her face. My teacher had given up on teaching me. So naturally, as a 5 year old, making it to first grade seemed impossible. But my mom told me to be patient and to never quit. Now, it was the last day of kindergarten and the teacher assigned one last assignment. The prompt was to write about anything you felt or learned in the school year so I stuck to the basics: the ABC’s. And no Michael Jackson, they were not as easy as 1,2,3.</p>

                    <h1>Fail Fail Fail - James Johnson</h1>
                    <p>Hi guys. Last year, there was a super cool lecture held at UVU. An actor from a popular television show (which I will keep nameless) had flown in to speak to their drama department. My awesome older sister checked me out of school to take me to see it. He talked about his show and working in the acting business. At the end he opened it up for questions, and out of the gigantic crowd, he called on me. I asked if he had any good advice for actors, and he gave me the greatest piece of knowledge that I’ve ever received. He said only three words, “Fail, fail, fail.” At first I was confused, and I thought to myself, “Wait, don’t we want to avoid failure? Aren’t we supposed to succeed in life?” He went on to explain that the only way that we can improve is by failing, and learning from those experiences. He said that he went to dozens of auditions, and instead of quitting, he chose to learn something new with each failure.  Eventually, after working very hard to utilize all that he learned, he was able to get the leading role in which he currently resides. So, in order to succeed, we must learn from our failures and put in the necessary work to be better.</p>

                    <h1>High School is a Womb - Max Bradshaw</h1>
                    <p>Babies scare me. An odd statement, I'm aware. I am also aware that they are completely harmless, but so is Coach Watabe and yet a lot of people seem to be scared of him. Despite all the cute cuddliness that a baby inherently possesses, there is something about them that freaks me out. Maybe I've simply watched too many horror movies with a devil baby in them. But it’s probably the fact that I too, used to be in that helpless and dependent state. And 17 years later, while I may be just as helpless and dependent, now I’m supposed to be graduating and doing stuff on my own.<br>
                        High school is exactly like being in a womb. Okay… well maybe not exactly but you get the idea. It is where we, as fetuses, are nurtured in the claustrophobic space that is the middle school hallway. We slowly grow and our organs develop. (But that actually happens in the classrooms, so maybe the middle school hallway is the placenta? I'm pretty sure this is getting too weird… it is, isn't it?). We learn what we are and aren't good at. What we aspire to be, and what we don't want to be. In short, we learn and develop who we are. We also learn more about the world around us through all of the classes that we take. Not only do we learn how to find the rate at which a potato cools using some major math skills (or a lack thereof in my case), but we also learn about people. Who we like, who we want to be around, who inspires us to become a better person and the opposite of those as well. We learn how to deal with all of these. And just when we think we are actually starting to figure this whole thing out and getting comfortable; we are thrust out unceremoniously (since the actual graduation ceremony is basically a delivery room with a little more fanfare, and a lot more spectators) and are now expected to use all of these skills​ we have just developed. And if we can't survive with the amount of development we have, we die, or at least require some major medical attention.</p>

                    <h1>Shopping-Melina Lewis</h1>
                    <p>Life is like a grocery store. Overhead are tall ceilings and below are floors smudged with skid marks made by the cart with the gimpy wheel. Each aisle sprawls across the building offering something unique: crunchy peanut butter, yogurt, grapes, Fruity Pebbles, Duncan Hines lemon cake mixes, pork knuckles, or whole grain bread. There is something for everyone. That’s the beauty of a grocery store, you choose what you select. Dill or sweet gherkin, Haagen dazs or Ben & Jerry’s, Hershey's or Toblerone, organic or hormone-infused.

                <h1>The Fantastic Voyage - Braden Christiansen</h1>
                <p>You would think after four years of Highschool that I would be great at staying up late to write Last Lectures and finish Calculus integrals but I'm not. You would have to be really good at math in order to count the times I have heard a teacher say you just need to work hard.<br>
                    People always say hard work is the way to succeed at anything. Do you want to write a great paper? Work hard, ask people for their opinions but you need to make an effort. What never gets recognised however is that there are times that trying your best and working hard doesn’t pay off and it's really hard to hear somebody say you could have done better when you tried as hard as you could. How most people manage that is by becoming objective hard workers. Picking aspects of their life that they will work hard at. One of those aspects for me is playing soccer. I've played for almost all of my life but I only realised that I wanted to be good at it my Freshmen year. So naturally by senior year you would think that I was at least decent at the game to the point where I could start varsity, the end goal for any soccer player, but if you're thinking that then you obviously don’t know me very well because I have the coordination of a blind astronaut.</p>
