                <h1>Human-James Han</h1>
                <p>Can we talk? I need to tell you something. Before I do, I just want to let you know that this is my deepest and darkest secret. I hope this doesn’t change the way you see me, but I feel the need to inform you more about my life. I’m a fish. I know, I know, you’re probably thinking, “James, you’re not a fish! You’re crazy.”Yes, I am a little crazy, but I promise, I am a fish. As a little kid my dad would frequently smile at me, place his hand on my shoulder, and cheer, “Son, you can be anything you want to be.” The thing is, I never chose to be a fish. The fish life chose me. Before freshman year of high school started, I created a mantra: I want to be a human! I want two legs that can run for miles, and walk for hundreds. Arms that can wiggle, dangle, and maybe even slap people when needed. And so that was my goal. The only way I was going to survive high school was to become a human. I created such a realistic human costume that none of my friends even suspected that I was a fish. I put my costume on every morning, lifted my head high, and played the part of a human. If I acted long enough, I figured that eventually I would just become one.

                <h1>Introvert’s Guide To Seizing The Day-Lauren Butler</h1>
                <p>An overstimulated awkwardly placed hermit crab. This is the visual to best describe high school me. And high school me is soon to be a part of my life exiting stage right, so while I’m here let me get out some last few nuggets of wisdom I’ve learned this past bit of my life. I have been going to Maeser for four years now, so I have three years of watching Last Lectures speeches under my belt. I have noticed a theme while watching these talks: Seize the day.

                <h1>Let’s Get Naked-Kalei Tuia</h1>
                <p>The number of times I have rewritten, re-done, revised, and re-started this paper is ridiculous considering the fact that it's still not that good. Bear with me as I attempt to change your perspective in 750 words. But first, if you could all do me a favor. Turn to your neighbor and high five them. Okay, now look out this window into the sun. Okay, so if for some reason you don't get anything out of my amazing paper at least you can say you've been touched and you've seen the light. </p>

                <h1>The Hideous Truth of Joy - Christian Cheung</h1>
                <p>Everyday I am bombarded with choices. In the morning I get to choose if I want to eat frosted flakes or fruity pebbles. In the winter I get to choose to freeze to death or wear a winter jacket and get yelled at by Mr Dowdle. At the end of the term I get to choose if I want to do the huge project due the next day that's worth half of my grade or cry myself to sleep.<br>
                    But I had one choice five years ago that would change my life drastically.  It was the choice of not moving to Hong Kong with my family. You guys might think not living with your parents is the best thing ever… and it is the best thing ever… but only for the first few months. The first few months is total freedom! No one is around to bug you about anything. Everything is going perfect. Then it hits you’re failing half of your classes, you can’t see the ground in your room, and no one is there to tuck you into bed at night. At that moment, you realize you miss your family.</p>

                <h1>Whiteboards-Jason Allan</h1>
                <p>For the last decade I have attended Public Schools across Utah, moving around the state a lot for various reasons, all of which very annoying. In some of those schools I had friends, in most I didn’t. Lasting relationships have always been something I have struggled with because of this. Though having only a few friends does come with benefits sometimes, trust me.
