# Maeser Last Lecture Site
![powered by Jekyll](https://img.shields.io/badge/powered_by-Jekyll-yellow.svg)

> A student, faculty, and alumni maintained website for the Last Lectures given at Karl G. Maeser Prep Academy.

This site was built to maintain and present a list of past Last Lectures given at Karl G. Maeser Preperatory Academy during the Last Lecture Assembly. The graduating seniors spend their last year preparing a final lecture for the student body to share wisdom learned with remaining classmates and faculty. After a round of judging, the top 10 lectures are presented in the school, then three winners selected by a panel of faculty and alumni.
