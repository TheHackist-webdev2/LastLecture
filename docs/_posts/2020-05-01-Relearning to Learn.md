Freshman year my life took a huge turn. My mom passed away. It was the hardest thing that had
ever happened to me. To preface, let me tell you a little bit about her. Her name is Christine. She loves classical music. Her favorite color is red. I could tell her about anything in the whole wide world and she would always just understand. And she changed people’s lives. She changed mine. So now I’m going to share with all of you some of what Christine did for me.

First of all she showed me how to love a good book. How to run home, jump in bed and disappear inside another world for hours. And then Mrs. Smith taught me that a book could change my life. That Jean Valjean isn’t just some character in a book, but that now he’s a little part of Thomas Vick.

Christine showed me that I had someone who would always be behind me. She showed me when she drove to cheer me on at every one of my soccer games, no matter how far. And then I saw that I had a team behind me. I saw when I scored my first varsity goal and my teammates rushed to me with flushed faces and their eyes glowed with the same joy that mine did. She showed me that school is important. She showed me by being the smartest person I ever knew. She showed me by giving up her time to help me with every assignment I struggled with. And then Mrs. Macduff showed me that the things I learned in school could benefit me my entire life. Twenty five dollars a month now is hundreds of thousands in the future, get investing people.

Christine showed me how to pick good friends. She showed me when I saw the excitement on her face as she picked up the phone to answer a call from her best friend. And then at Maeser I didn’t have to pick good friends. Because you all picked me the second I walked through those big pillars out front.

She showed me that tough love helps you grow. She showed me when she let me figure out problems on my own and ignored my incessant whining. And then Mr. Watabe showed me that something good can actually come from running a seventeen-nine at practice. And believe it or not that you can learn from that soul crushing experience of not knowing the right answer when he calls on you in math. Or even worse, when you confidently state the wrong one.

She showed me how to be strong. She was so strong. She showed me when she would come to my room after a round of chemo and make sure that my trivial day of middle school had been A- okay. And then Mrs. Cannon showed me how to take the pain of the ones you love and turn it into something beautiful. She showed me every time she talked about her daughter, and helped us all become a little better.

And Christine made me cry. She made me cry because I missed her. And then I laughed. I laughed because Mr. Simmons told my class a story about his own dumb self in High School, because he knew that’s what we needed to hear that day.

So why? Why do I share Christine with you? Because Christine is my mom, and she taught me everything I know. And she may be gone, but she’ll be with me forever. And you guys? You’re my family. You managed to teach me too. And though it's time for me to leave this family, it is one that will never leave me. The person on your right and the person on your left? They’re your family. So learn from them. And as you continue on with your lives, in class, in sports, in printcomm, in drama, I just want you to remember what I learned from Christine, and what you learn every day from your Maeser family. And then you can leave this place like I’m about to. Not knowing everything, not as a perfect person, but you’ll be just a little bit better than when you first walked in. And I promise you’ll be just a little more prepared for the next great adventure life has in store for you.
