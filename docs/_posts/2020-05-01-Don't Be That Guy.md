Man, I remember the first day of seventh grade like it was... wow 6 years huh? Damb.

Where did all the time go? Oh yeah, to Maeser. I forget, Maeser is its own dimension. Years turn into seconds, classes last an eternity,
teachers turn into life-coaches and friends, Deans turn into dumpster Firefighters, and soar stays boring as heck. I guess this is it.
This is my senior year, isn’t it? What’s my legacy?

This has been a question for 6 years of my life. Knowing that this doomsday clock is ticking down, I’ve erased and rewritten this now
6 different times. Some of you seniors out there already have this written, and to that I applaud you. For me, impossible. Nothing.
My head is empty, there isn’t a legacy that I can think of. Brendan Murphy, Ammon Hasson and I built a boat in 10th grade, but I don’t
have that boat anymore. I was starting second baseman two years in a row for our very own baseball team, but I’m graduating. I was on
the track team until our season was taken away from us. I would say that I’m a graduate of Karl G Maeser, but I haven’t done that yet.
I can be funny during class, but I guess I won’t have any classes here anymore will I?

I got it! Don’t be that guy.

You know exactly what I am talking about. We all know. That guy is someone who will walk behind his crush and kick their knees out.
They’re the type of person that will go into the bathroom, get wet paper towels, and throw them on the ceiling to see who;s could stick
the longest. They constantly don’t care about their grades, and they don’t care about other people. They have a sense of entitlement, as
if the whole school owes them something. I’m here to tell you, hey can you please not be that way? This is probably completely unheard of
for a Last Lecture, but I’m going to ask for some audience participation. Now, keep in mind this is very important for “That guy” to hear,
and I’m sure that Gerber has dreamt of doing this for many years now. But on the count of three, we’re all going to say “Don’t be that guy”
together. One, two, three. Don’t be that guy! Great, now that the people around you know you just responded to a video like a child watching
Dora, I can move on.

You might be wondering, “Hey Mikey, how do I not be that guy?” To that, I say it’s easy! Just be nice! I’ve done it for 6 years, or at least
tried to. Service has been my main motivation for these past 6 years, and I can genuinely say that has helped me become the person that I want
to be today. When I look back on the years that I have spent asking people what I can do to help, I can’t help but want to help someone again
and again. Once, one of my friends was having a hard time, so I brought her some ice cream. Sure, that isn’t a big gesture, ice cream for a
friend, but I can tell you that she probably still thinks about it sometimes.

In conclusion Maeser, the last thing I want to leave with you is a reminder that any gesture, big or small, counts against any points earned
from being “That guy.” If what I’ve done matters, what you do matters just as much, if not more. I’ve been here 6 years, and known a lot of
“those guys”, but I can say that through my service, instead of being “that guy”, I’m me.
