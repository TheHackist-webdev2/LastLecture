There is nothing more terrifying than to know that you might get convicted of a crime you didn’t commit and receive a
criminal record that would ruin the rest of your life. It was September 2019 and I found myself here, at the Provo police
department. This is the place where a real-life detective took me into a small investigation room with a 2-way mirror and
interrogated me. Just like the Movies. It was truly one of the most terrifying experiences of my life.

Now to explain how I got here let’s come here; to Cold Stone Creamery in Provo. It was September 11 of last year. I had been
working here about a year when one late night I got scammed. Malicious people brewed up a well-crafted plan to steal money
from unsuspecting employees, a perfect target being myself: A totally unsuspecting naive teenager. Now I don't want to go
into details because it brings me physical pain retelling the story. I have tried to block that experience out of my brain
so reliving it all over again is very, very uncomfortable. But to make a long story short I got scammed, and after I got
scammed, the police department and my mother thought that I had stolen the money.

Luckily I don’t have a criminal record and I learned some valuable lessons, so, things worked out. But my long story is not
what’s important. What is important is that I didn’t listen to a small voice in my head. While I was getting scammed there
was a small voice in the back of my head whispering to me: maybe this is not a good idea. My conscience was telling me the
right thing to do but pressure from others, fear, and exhaustion clouded it, so I couldn’t hear it.

If you Google what’s the definition of conscience, It will say: “an inner feeling or voice viewed as acting as a guide to the
rightness or wrongness of one's behaviour.” So by definition, It’s your brain using your moral compass to decipher between good
and bad decisions; like having a devil and angel on your shoulder. But I believe your conscience is much greater than that and
has the potential to make a tremendous impact on your life.

To explain myself let me take you to the Maeser track, here. Late last year I found myself pacing around this track absolutely
terrified knowing that in a few minutes I would have to walk inside and recite a memorized monologue to Mr Hults, and Ms Smith.
I was not an actor and what I was doing was totally out of my comfort zone. Why would I do that to myself? Because earlier I had
a choice. I could either try out for Shakespeare or not try out for Shakespeare. Neither of those choices was bad, but my
conscience was still trying to tell me something.

It was telling me that I should try out for Shakespeare, a new and exciting experience. The rational, reasoning part of my brain
was battling my conscience with self-doubt and fear of failure. It was telling me: I’m not an actor! I’ll just look like a fool!
Even if I try out I’ll lose all the good roles to more experienced actors.

Thank the heavens I listened to my conscience! Because of that one decision to listen to my conscience, I discovered new talents,
met amazing people, landed the role as the Beast, won third place and the Shakespeare Festival, and composed music alongside Sam
Cardon, a famous comper.

Our consciences aren’t just used to differentiate between good and bad decisions. Our conscience help shows us opportunities that
will change our lives. Yours may be telling you to have that uncomfortable conversation you’ve been dreading for years. It may be
telling you to try out for that new sport or learn that new instrument. It may tell you to treat your mother a little more kindly
or talk that friend you haven’t seen in a while. In any case, you’ll have excuses to not listen to your conscience, just like I
did when I was trying to decide whether to audition or not. If you ignore all the excuses and listen to your conscience which is
most often telling you to do something difficult and uncomfortable, I know It will change your life in ways you are not expecting.
