May 11, at 11:02pm, I had a revelation about what to write. Steaming water pouring over
my face, I was enjoying my midnight meditations with some Exfoliation Charcoal Old Spice.
Then, I thought about something that ruined my tranquil waterfall escape. What startled me was
you. Not just you, but the fact that you students at Maeser, STINK. That's right: You. Smell. Bad!

So, to wash off that nasty miasma of your stench, I leave you one simple piece of advice:
WEAR DEODORANT. I know you think it’s not all that important, and Gerber will tell you
repeatedly to wear it, but trust me when I say you don't know how noticeable it is when you
don’t practice this one simple hygienic habit.

Let me share with you how I learned about deodorant at Maeser. In seventh grade, I
didn’t know what deodorant was. There were a lot of unknowns for me, coming to a new school,
and I was scared—no, I was petrified. I had stepped out of my comfort zone, and on top of that,
puberty was beginning to enter the picture. What I experienced was tough, depressing, and
lonely. It wasn't until Boston Sharp started a conversation with me in Latin that I realized I was
at a good school, surrounded by opportunities to make lasting friendships. I still remember the
time he taught me how to apply deodorant: one, two, three on each side. My odors were no more,
changed into a subtle characteristic smell of tonic and something fresh.

Eighth grade I learned that too much deodorant can become intoxicating. By lathering too
much on, it left a ripe scent that forever lingers in middle school main and in the boys locker
room. If only to make things worse, using perfumes and colognes is in no way appealing: don’t
try to mask your stench with too many fake fragrances.

At one point, I got Lavender deodorant because a peer told me that women enjoy when a
man smells flowery, and smelling like a fresh field of violet flowers was definitely noticeable.
Reminded of the deodorant’s potent impression, I began to do things that would leave a lasting
scent. From when I held hands with Robbie Menssen for 5 minutes in Arches National Park for a
photo, to choking on Dr. Pepper while Georgia Johnson and I laughed maniacally after making
eye contact, and from singing Canaan Days with Kristian Keller in a bathrobe, to stargazing with
McKenna Smeltzer against the soft grass, I began to find purpose in making connections and
taking action to preserve them.

After this initial experience with finding the right deodorant, I discovered the best
fragrance for me: Charcoal Exfoliation from Old Spice. Not only did the “nose” know that this
was a good scent, but the earthy undertones matched my natural aroma, and this blend left
behind something subtle and inviting. I finally felt confident with who I was, and my deodorant
reflected that. I felt comfortable showing my intellectual vulnerability in a Socratic discussion, or
showcasing my pride in the Shakespeare Competition, or accepting that I was important to
friends and family.

But there's more to my message than applying the correct amount of deodorant. It is
about using your sense of smell. The nose is an amazing tool, often disregarded as a lesser sense,
yet we use it all the time. Think about it: when you go to senior prom with your best friend, you
remember her sweet fragrance of perfume and the complimentary corsage you made for her.
When you perform the WAP dance at a private homecoming, you remember the scent of warm
food and friendship. When you smell the crisp Classical texts in Maeser’s classrooms, you’re
reminded of Mr. Simmons’ love of The Iliad, or Mrs. Cannon’s obsession with Chocolate Cake,
or Ms. Smith’s attraction to Satan. When you’re in a cozy cabin during winterim, you recollect
the clashing aromas of 20 different body washes and deodorants. All of these scents are
connected to memories of a fragment of your life that changes who you are forever.

We just emerged from a pandemic that nullified smell. Only when affected, you noticed
its importance. The regularity in which we use our smell is vital to how we experience the world,
so make a difference by remembering to smell good. Take your disgusting selves and use the
incredible gifts of deodorant and proper hygiene to transform life’s tang into a po-pouri of
memorable colognes and lingering perfumes.
