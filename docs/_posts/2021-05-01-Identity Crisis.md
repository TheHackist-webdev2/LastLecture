Maryn Alayna Gulledge. Track and Field. NHS. AP Art. Rock climber. Gymnastics
coach. That’s what you’ll hear when my name is called at graduation. If you don’t know me, now
you do, I guess. I wanted to put “gymnast” on the list but it didn’t make the cut because
technically I’m not a gymnast anymore.

I started gymnastics at our city rec center when I was four years old and before I knew it
once a week lessons turned into four hour practices Monday through Friday. I loved the sound of
medals clinking as they bounced off my sparkly leotard when I walked out of a competition. I
loved it even when I walked out with tear stained cheeks and taped up ankles. I loved the fun
games my coaches had us play and the dumb dances we made up during practice. I loved it even
when the AC broke in the middle of summer and we still had to do conditioning. I loved
cheering nicknames and tackling my teammates with hugs and high fives after they got a
personal best. I loved it even when I chose to say goodbye to them.

As Sophomore year came around, the head coach had a conversation with my mom and
said, “I’m going to say that college gymnastics just isn’t in the cards for her.” This hurt more
than a slap in the face. Collegiate gymnastics has been my goal for as long as the signed posters
of BYU’s 2012 team were up on my ceiling. Even though these dream crushing words gave me
the perfect topic to write my Best Scar Essay about, it left me questioning everything.

When my dad introduces our family he always says, starting with Jordan (not Meagan),
“This is my dancer, then I have my two gymnasts, my artist, a singer, and a crazy toddler.” So
when I stopped doing gymnastics I remember asking, “What am I now dad?”

This is when I went through a midlife identity crisis as a 15 year old. The hardest choice
I’ve ever had to make was to retire from gymnastics, after 12 dedicated years of it being the most
important part of my life. Until that point, being a gymnast was my entire identity. But I want
you all to know I didn’t quit just because someone told me I’m not good enough; I retired from
gymnastics because after countless pro/con lists and prayers, I decided there was more to high
school that I wanted to experience. I wanted to take a class for fun, not just because I needed it to
graduate. I wanted one of those fancy pins you put on your blazer that gives you the power to
decide what theme homecoming decorations will be. I wanted to wear one of the very flattering
Maeser sports uniforms and have my UHSSA stats come up when you google my name. But
what I really wanted was to be more than just a gymnast.

That’s when I began to realize it’s not the things we do that define us, it’s who we are; but
what we do can help shape us into who we are. Being a gymnast isn’t my identity, but doing
gymnastics did help make me who I am. My dad wasn’t wrong when he introduced me as a
gymnast, but he also didn’t give the complete picture. He put me under a label, boiling me down
to the bullet points of what I do for the sake of keeping an introduction short. So, while I have
your attention, let’s try this again.

Maryn Alayna Gulledge. Will give it my all even when I know I won’t win. In my happy
place when things are organized. Too scared to eat pancakes or talk to anyone on 7th grade day.
Can’t get me to be quiet around friends and can eat more than you’d think. Cries when Mrs.
Frampton gives 5/6 Socratic another poetry assignment. Can’t live a day without chapstick.
Uncomfortable around animals, especially when middle schoolers act like them. Convinced my
mood is directly correlated to whether or not the sun is out. Senior in the class of 2021, even if
Mr. Watabe never remembers I am. Not just a gymnast.
