There are days that stick with you forever. You can remember almost everything. The sun shining through the windows,
the delicious Kneaders buttermilk syrup and the blue vans you wear everyday. These days usually are the most impactful
of your life and the majority of the time you don't know when they are coming. I had one of those days my Sophomore year.
Cody and I were at Kneaders eating breakfast. I chose the pancakes of course. Our intentions were to hangout and have
some good pancakes. But Cody and I did not know what our conversation would lead to.

Through the flow of the conversation I told my dear friend Cody that I had a pornography problem and had for a few years.
Iâ€™m not telling you this as a confession or making my lecture to scare you straight. This is merely a small point in the
greater lesson. The reason I share this is to teach that we all are on our own journey and surrounded by mentors and friends
that will help us. Cody did just that. He helped me like a loyal companion would. He loved me and guided me, lifted me up
and caused me to act for good. I felt like I was Frodo from the film masterpiece known as the Lord Of the Rings. Without
Frodos friends and group to support him, he would have been lost on his way and fallen under the dark powers of the ring.
It was Sam who carried him through the last part of the journey and it was Sam who helped him destroy the ring and rid
middle Earth of evil.

Cody was my Sam.

There was great help from many people, not just Cody. If it was just Cody I do not think I could give this address.
My fellowship is made of people like Kara, Mz, May, Mrs Cannon, Simmons and others who helped me.

My loyal friend Kara was the first person I told in 8th grade. I was sitting in my basement with my cracked Ipad in
fear she would judge me. But the exact opposite. She showed me great love and expressed how much she hoped I could
get better and overcome my trial.

Kara was my Aragorn.

I learned that when I shared with the right people I had more people to keep me accountable. Mz was one who helped
push me the most. I view her like a second mom so I tried my best to heed to her advice.

Mz was my Gandalf.

I have found my fellowship at Maeser. It has changed over the years but since 7th grade I have surrounded myself with people
who lift me up just as Frodo's friends lifted him. My advice to you is find your own fellowship like Frodo and I have done.
Be mindful of who is in your fellowship, you want friends and peers who will uplift you. Going at life's challenges alone is
an impossible task. It is important you have the right people beside you. Imagine Frodo's journey if he didn't have his friends
to help him. Don't try to fight your battles alone.

Find your fellowship and enjoy the journey and don't make it harder than it needs to be. Find someone like Gandalf who will show
you right and wrong and teach you the way to go. Find someone like Aragorn who has faith in you always and believes you can do
anything. Get a friend like Pippin, with their infectious sense of humor they will always make you smile. Most importantly get
a friend like Sam who will never give up on you. No matter what, they will stay by your side, and lift you up to be better.
They will even carry you when you do not have the strength. Find a fellowship like Frodo. people who love you and support you
and want to make sure you succeed in your journey. Maeser is filled with people who can support you. The best way to find them
is by telling people your struggles, and be honest with yourself and others. I have been blessed to have loyal friends to help
me along my journey and what I hope more than anything is that every single one of you can find your own Maeser fellowship.
