                <h1>Fear - Sarah Sorenson</h1>
                <p>Your heart beats faster than a galloping horse’s hooves, a rhythm so intense you can feel it pulsing from within your skull. Fictional characters always seem to worry about whoever is pursuing them being able to hear the frantic thumps, but no author can capture the sheer strength and volume of a heart that fears it may soon stop pumping. The rest of your body seems to get the message quite quickly and a shiver makes its way down your spine; eyes widen and hands begin to tremble as you realize what exactly has caused this involuntary response. You try to turn and run, but you soon understand what it means to be paralyzed by fear. You’ve become helpless in the face of this monstrosity, and your frozen body has left you completely at its mercy. Time seems to go faster and slower simultaneously, and it feels like you’re just there to watch. It doesn’t really matter what you insert into this, whether it be spiders, mind numbingly high drops, or clowns. Fear is fear, and it is an immensely powerful emotion. In Yann Martel’s Life of Pi, it is accurately described less as an irrational feeling and more as the rival of life. Fear is life’s true opponent because it begins in the mind, it can take control of people’s lives, and it is more powerful than death.

                <h1>Day of Love - Myrna Velasco</h1>
                <p>One of the most fascinating concepts of human behavior to me is the fact that we don’t do things other species do to just stay alive, but to feel like we are actually living. The prime example of this is love. The laws of survival tell us we should eat, sleep, keep our species going, and do whatever it takes to not die. If you think about it, love makes us do some things that are out of accordance with these laws. We give up sleep to be on a phone call  with our significant other that has been going for two hours already. We share food with friends even though we were saving that for later. We risk injuries and failure for sports, dance, and art, but we do these things anyway. Love is sacrifice. Love is giving a portion of your life to someone or something willingly.  Love is letting something/someone know you and change you. Love is about caring for something or someone before thinking about yourself. I love the word “falling” in the phrase “falling in love” because it embodies the feeling perfectly. Once you start, it’s really hard to catch yourself or stop; you are subject to obey a force that is out of your control. You can either resist and brace yourself for impact, or you can spread your arms and dive in head first. It also implies that the outcome in unknown; you could be falling on gravel, or you could be falling into a memory foam mush pit of joy. I don’t know about you, but I’m terrified of heights. Falling can be scary, especially when you don’t know how hard you are going to fall or what you are going to land on. But as far away as we try to get from the ledge, our instinct to love brings us back every time. Nature tells us to protect ourselves;, but our humanity tells us to love. It always comes back to it. Our society cannot run without love. Why else would parents work several jobs to provide for their children? Why would children assign themselves responsibilities to care for a creature of a completely different species then cry when it dies or gets lost? Why else would teachers stay long hours, talk through our problems, give us an education, all with relatively small income for hundreds of students who do not belong to them? Why would mothers willingly feel miserable for nine months then risk their lives to bring you here if they did not love you? Whether it is for a person, a sport, a pet, an idea, a hobby, or a profession, everything revolves around love. It is the greatest motivation. I believe iit is the best thing we do.</p>

                <h1>Become Uncomfortable, Become Vulnerable, Now Change - Abigail Crist</h1>
                <p>You’ve probably by this point heard me talk about Acting Up, if not here’s a rundown. Acting Up is my second home, a place where I truly felt free to be me. I love Acting Up and I don’t think I realized that until a couple weeks ago. I have been in Acting Up for 3 years, for the first two years of it I gave my everything to this experience. In my third and final year, I shared it with my three best friends in the entire world: Katie, Rach, and TJ. Don’t get me wrong I’ve loved every minute of it, but I was nervous to completely show my musical theater side to my friends. The choice I had to make was difficult and thinking about it now I still don’t know how I did it. I made the choice to become vulnerable with my best friends. I know that might be like a, “Um Abby they’re your best friends. You should already be vulnerable with them,” but I promise you it’s different.</p>
