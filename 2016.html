First thing first I eat your brain, I’m start rocking gold teeth and fangs cause that’s what a motherloving monster do hairdresser from Milan is the monster shoe.”

                <h1>Done Goof-Patrick Madden</h1>
                <p>Before I begin I would just like to say thank you to all of the incredible teachers and other staff here at Maeser. You have all been so wonderful to me. Even those that I’ve never had. I found that the easiest way to describe how I feel was said by Glen Phillips, “I often feel like the prodigal son, take all I need, giving back none.” There are too many times for me to count when I have been shown great kindness and love from the people of this school. So once again, thanks to everyone in the school, students and faculty alike. Now to my advice.</p>

                <h1>High School Eugoogly-Camila Ortega</h1>
                <p>In a few days I’m walking down the aisle. I’m not getting married, but something close to it, I’m marrying adulthood. I’ll leave childhood being completely honest. High school is nothing like High School Musical. Your sibling won’t ever agree to be your singing sidekick, people you love will hurt you and won’t sing you an apology, and people never fall in love over karaoke. But high school has taught me many valuable life lessons; like embracing who and what you love defines you, being happy is always an option, and dropping it too low to apple-bottom jeans when you’re wearing hair extensions is a guaranteed disaster. </p>

                <h1>He Gave Me His Hair-Katie Clark</h1>
                <p>He gave me his hair. It’s freshman year, chivalry week, and my knight in shining armor gave me his hair. Little did I know that, two years later, I would repay the favor with a handful of my own hair, as a joke, which he would craft into a voodoo doll and return to me. Little did I know that, senior year, he would ask me to Homecoming with a stuffed bunny, a homemade poem, and another lock of his silky dark hair. I never would have remembered chivalry week if my knight had done something boring, like hold open a door or buy me a flower; now, I will never forget.

                <h1>Human-James Han</h1>
                <p>Can we talk? I need to tell you something. Before I do, I just want to let you know that this is my deepest and darkest secret. I hope this doesn’t change the way you see me, but I feel the need to inform you more about my life. I’m a fish. I know, I know, you’re probably thinking, “James, you’re not a fish! You’re crazy.”Yes, I am a little crazy, but I promise, I am a fish. As a little kid my dad would frequently smile at me, place his hand on my shoulder, and cheer, “Son, you can be anything you want to be.” The thing is, I never chose to be a fish. The fish life chose me. Before freshman year of high school started, I created a mantra: I want to be a human! I want two legs that can run for miles, and walk for hundreds. Arms that can wiggle, dangle, and maybe even slap people when needed. And so that was my goal. The only way I was going to survive high school was to become a human. I created such a realistic human costume that none of my friends even suspected that I was a fish. I put my costume on every morning, lifted my head high, and played the part of a human. If I acted long enough, I figured that eventually I would just become one.

                <h1>Let’s Get Naked-Kalei Tuia</h1>
                <p>The number of times I have rewritten, re-done, revised, and re-started this paper is ridiculous considering the fact that it's still not that good. Bear with me as I attempt to change your perspective in 750 words. But first, if you could all do me a favor. Turn to your neighbor and high five them. Okay, now look out this window into the sun. Okay, so if for some reason you don't get anything out of my amazing paper at least you can say you've been touched and you've seen the light. </p>
