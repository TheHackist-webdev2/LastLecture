                <h1>Accepting the Label - Felix Resendiz Jr.</h1>
                <p>Who are you? It’s the question I ask myself as I stare into my soap stained mirror each morning as I’m brushing my teeth. This is how I start my day. It hasn’t always been my routine. When I was in grade school I was a fat kid. I was known as a Macho man not for my strength but for my size. Everyone assumed that I was full Mexican but little did they know I’m more Chilean than Mexican... Being fat and Chilean made it hard to accept who I am. I didn’t realized that I was just going through a physical phase. I was stereotyped as a mexican and no one cared to ask about my background   That impacted my life because I didn’t have the same respect like the other more “privileged” kid in this “white society and country”. Being how little I was I did not know that I could change, I didn’t like it.But as I got older I realized that I can change. I realized that I wasn’t apart of the stereotype, I spoke up more, I ran a little more, I became my own person.  I know that I am not the only one that has gone through this, everyone has or will go through this, solely for the fact they are different from one another.</p>

                        GPA Isn’t Forever-Abriel Rosenvall
                        </h1>
                    <p>If you are a Maeser student, you’ve probably done a couple things just for a grade. I’m sure anyone who has been through sophomore year has pulled all-nighters to finish those socratic projects. I have seen many students in Mr. Ensign’s room after school, trying to nail down those awful chemistry concepts. I’ve been part of that group of kids not paying attention in class, because we’re trying to finish our calculus homework for next period. I remember a group at the whiteout game who were reciting anatomical terms to one another in preparation for their test. And I know we’ve all tried texting friends during the unholy hours of the night to get the notes we missed that day. And for what? A grade. Because pain is temporary. GPA is forever. </p>

                    <h1>He Gave Me His Hair-Katie Clark</h1>
                    <p>He gave me his hair. It’s freshman year, chivalry week, and my knight in shining armor gave me his hair. Little did I know that, two years later, I would repay the favor with a handful of my own hair, as a joke, which he would craft into a voodoo doll and return to me. Little did I know that, senior year, he would ask me to Homecoming with a stuffed bunny, a homemade poem, and another lock of his silky dark hair. I never would have remembered chivalry week if my knight had done something boring, like hold open a door or buy me a flower; now, I will never forget.

                <h1>Last Lecture-Courtney Jarrett</h1>
                <p>Mr. Rogers said, “The world needs a sense of worth.” That is something that we really chase at Maeser. We want to know what’s true and what’s not, which principles are worth building our lives around. We look at centuries old text because we want to find those things that are of worth.

Bear with me as I attempt to change your perspective in 750 words. But first, if you could all do me a favor. Turn to your neighbor and high five them. Okay, now look out this window into the sun. Okay, so if for some reason you don't get anything out of my amazing paper at least you can say you've been touched and you've seen the light. </p>

                <h1>Life Before Death, Strength Before Weakness, Journey Before Destination - Taylor LaFranca</h1>
                <p>Life before death, fairly obvious right? I mean, we are living before we’re dead, so why is it important to say? Before I came to Maeser I had a life, but I wasn’t living it. Back in my old school, I was bullied and pushed around because I didn’t fit in. I was treated differently because I wasn’t who they wanted me to be. The phrase life before death means that we need to look at our lives, evaluate ourselves, and decide. “Am I really living my life?” I’ve been there, I know what it’s like to be alive, but not really living and I’m here to tell you, live your life, do what you want to do, not just what others expect you to do.</p>

                <h1>Mac and Cheese - Alexa Johnson</h1>
                <p>When I was younger I believed happiness was characterized by success, and success was characterized by one thing: Kraft Mac and Cheese. At age 5, I believed making my own pot of macaroni was the final frontier. My eyes brimming with determination, I marched home from the bus ready to tackle, what I considered, the ultimate accomplishment. After thrusting open the front door I shed my kindergarten sized backpack and pink lightup sketchers, internalizing every moment of food network I’d ever seen.</p>

                <h1>My Crowning Glory - Steven Lawrence</h1>
                <p>For the first half of high school I was a straight A, shyer than shy, kid. I spent most of my time playing video games and doing what it took to get straight A’s in school. Each morning after eating breakfast I would lay in bed wondering why I should get in the shower to go to school. This would happen until I became so stressed about what might happen if I were to miss a day of school that I would end up getting in the shower and going to school. I was miserable. But this misery motivated me to change. I decided to start getting involved in extracurricular activities. I joined science olympiad, math team, and tennis, even though I was the worst player on the team; I lost every match. I worried less about school and focused more on my happiness by spending more time with family and friends and seizing opportunities to serve. Once I went to a college party with a friend who attended BYU because it was her birthday. The next day I had a project due for physics and I did terrible on it. As a general rule, you should try to get your homework done before you party but don’t let it get in the way of family, friends, and serving those who need help. Education is important but your happiness is the reason for your existence.</p>

                <h1>What Do You Choose? - Shaun Cluff</h1>
                <p>I want to talk to you about choices. Let me tell you, you’re going to make a lot of them. Lucky for you though, I am the perfect person to give advice about this, because I am an Expert at making bad choices. At this point, you really start to think about all of the decisions you have made that have culminated to this moment. I remember as a sophomore I CHOSE to stay up till 2 am memorizing a monologue that I had procrastinated for a long time. In 9th grade I CHOSE to throw a pencil in 7th period biology that somehow ended up hitting Mr. Kreitzer in the forehead, earning me a trip to Mrs. Ellis’s office. Even this year I CHOSE to give Mrs. Macduff a heart attack when I almost got ran over in London. You see, these choices are  probably not the best, but there are some decisions I made with my education here at Maeser that I actually deeply regret. Choices that held me back from my potential. But Regret is not what got me here today. What I have learned at Maeser is how to make the right choices (most of the time, i’m still learning), and I hope that you can come to that same realization faster than I did.</p>

                <h1>Weakness is Like A Thought - Erica Hendrickson</h1>
                <p>Mr. Simmons sprained my ankle once; he probably doesn't remember. It was four years ago at the end-of- the-year Quidditch match. One of the best friends I’ve ever had introduced me to the team two weeks earlier.<br>
                    The very first position I had was the one I disliked the most, keeper. As a freshman, I didn’t know how to play. I basically knew I was supposed to guard the hoops and prevent someone from making a goal.</p>
