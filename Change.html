                <h1>Breaking Up - Dylan Armstrong</h1>
                <p>So you may have heard, I’m graduating next week. I know it’s crazy right. Me of all people. One day and then it’s all over, I never see any of you again. (Well unless you are James Johnson, then you’ve been stuck with me since 2nd grade and I’m living across the street from you at college, so you're never getting rid of me.) What I mean to say is this isn’t working, and no it’s not me, it’s mostly you. It is over. I’m breaking up with you. All of you. (Even you Allyson.) We are never ever getting back together, like ever. I mean we’ve been together for six years… but it’s time to move on. I mean I’m going to college next year, and I don’t want a long distance relationship, it’s time to say goodbye. It’s over, but that doesn’t mean none of it mattered. I’ve learned so much from you, Maeser has taught me how to be me. It’s the end, but the end is just the begining of another journey. I’m sure you’ll find someone else. So since this is goodbye, I wanted to tell you I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all my bad jokes, late assignments, and mistakes that I’ve made. I’ll miss you. I’ll miss the environment a small of high school, the teachers actually knowing my name, and all the friends I made along the way. I forgive you. I forgive you for all the late night assignments, for full dress Monday’s, and for the most stressful years of my life. Finally, I love you. I love you for showing me who I should aim to be, for all the fun I had along the way, and for the best years of my life. Goodbye Maeser, I hope we can still be friends.</p>

                <h1>Become Uncomfortable, Become Vulnerable, Now Change - Abigail Crist</h1>
                <p>You’ve probably by this point heard me talk about Acting Up, if not here’s a rundown. Acting Up is my second home, a place where I truly felt free to be me. I love Acting Up and I don’t think I realized that until a couple weeks ago. I have been in Acting Up for 3 years, for the first two years of it I gave my everything to this experience. In my third and final year, I shared it with my three best friends in the entire world: Katie, Rach, and TJ. Don’t get me wrong I’ve loved every minute of it, but I was nervous to completely show my musical theater side to my friends. The choice I had to make was difficult and thinking about it now I still don’t know how I did it. I made the choice to become vulnerable with my best friends. I know that might be like a, “Um Abby they’re your best friends. You should already be vulnerable with them,” but I promise you it’s different.</p>

                <h1>Doing Things - Bennett Felstead</h1>
                <p>Charles Darwin once said “It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change”. Now, while Charlie Darwin never actually said that, I still think it’s a good point. The most important thing that I learned from going to high school, was how to accustom myself to different situations, or as a normal person would say, how to adapt. One of the major things that I had to adapt to was to, as I eloquently put it, do things. Let me explain. I don’t mean the typical ‘go to every single thing ever and do all that you can always at the school’. I mean that I needed to start breaking the habit of not doing what I was supposed to do. I feel like we have all been in that situation, when you need to do some big project and instead of doing it early, you wait until that last second just to, you know, make your brain have a panic attack. I remember I had a physics project where we had to build a mousetrap car. It was due on thursday, so naturally I was going to wait until wednesday night to start it. But, this is when I realized that procrastination is an evil thing. I woke up monday, went to school, only to realize that the car was due that day… I failed that class. Now, realizing that procrastination is a bad thing is very different from actually doing something about your procrastination. It’s very hard to switch from something you’ve been doing for so long. But trust me, it’s worth the effort.</p>

                <h1>Mr. Perfect-Sam Garrison</h1>
                <p>Perfection is a blank canvas. The surface rests untouched. Upon further inspection, no mark or indent can be found. Critics approach skeptically and search carefully. They lean back in approval, for they have found no fault. The canvas leaves no impression, for it has not been impressed. There is nothing to commend, but nothing to critique. Therein lies safety, comfort. The creator remains safe, protected. No fault can be found in a blank canvas. The critics continue to come, but they find no critique. As long as the material is perfect and clear, the creator is safe. Overtime, control is lost, with the owner stagnating. Now a slave to the fear of maintaining a blank canvas.

                <h1> Offense: The Wall Between Us-Dillon Frost</h1>
                <p>432000 minutes. My time at Maeser: 432000 precious minutes spent listening, reading, taking notes, and cramming for tests. In these minutes lies all of my education, where I have been given enough information pertaining to everything from Utah history to AP calculus to fill a small library. Reflecting on all of this time and the vast knowledge I have gained, one single fact stands out. I have forgotten almost all of it. No type of learning has been impervious to the onslaught of my faulty human brain. Dates, equations, plot lines, CPR training, definitions, and brilliant revelations are all now grains of sand on the vast deserts of what I have lost.</p>
